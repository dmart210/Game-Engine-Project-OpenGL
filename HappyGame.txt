I created a game where there is one sprite whose purpose is to slay as many enemies as possible. The only caveat about the sprite is that every time he slays an enemy he gets weak. In this game, the player has the original sprite which is white, and for every x amount of enemies that he slays, he gets more red and eventually perishes. The way I did this was I created a counter inside the game where when the X collisions happen, it causes the sprite to change to a different sprite. There are 4 different sprites: white, yellow, red, and perished. The way I implemented this was I used the UnitsOverlap function to detect every time the sprites would intersect, and for every instance, the counter would start. One other feature I added to this game was when the sprite eventually perishes, a game-over image appears and all of the enemies disappear. I also created bounds of how far the sprite can go where if the sprite goes too far on one side, it returns back to the original position before that position was revealed.
